
h2(#PivotParsingConstraints). Parsing Constraints and Queries

This section may be contrasted with the corresponding "Parsing Constraints and Queries":#ParsingConstraints for the Ecore binding to see examples of the small changes needed to migrate from the Ecore binding to the Pivot binding.

The OCL parser provides two APIs for parsing constraint and query expressions. The "@OCLHelper@":http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/ocl/javadoc/4.0.0/org/eclipse/ocl/examples/pivot/helper/OCLHelper.html interface is designed primarily for parsing constraints and query expressions
embedded in models, such as Ecore or UML models.  The "@OCL@":http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/ocl/javadoc/4.0.0/org/eclipse/ocl/examples/pivot/OCL.html class serves as the main entrypoint into the parsing API but also implements the
parsing of "OCL documents":#PivotParsingDocuments, for example from
text files.  In both cases, the concept of @Environment@
is crucial.

h3. The OCL Environment

The @OCL@ API provides a Facade for the various objects that support different aspects of OCL parsing and evaluation activities in a that spans activities for which the meta-models remain unchanged. A new OCL Facade is required if the meta-models change.

The "@OCL@":http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/ocl/javadoc/4.0.0/org/eclipse/ocl/examples/pivot/OCL.html class is a simple type.

There is no need for the Ecore/UML template parameters that parameterize the equivalent Ecore/UML class.

Behind the scenes, the unified Pivot variants of the primary UML, OCL and user and meta-models, complementing Complete OCL documents and Standard Libraries are maintained by a
"@MetaModelManager@":http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/ocl/javadoc/4.0.0/org/eclipse/ocl/examples/pivot/manager/MetaModelManager.html, which also maintains all the collection and tuple specialization singletons so that they can be shared by subsequent processing. A distinct @MetaModelManager@ is required for each combination of primary meta-models and complementing Complete OCL documents and so for safety a new @MetaModelManager@ is created for each OCL session. Increased metya-model sharing can be achieved by re-using @MetaModelManager@ s when constructing a
"@PivotEnvironmentFactory@":http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/ocl/javadoc/4.0.0/org/eclipse/ocl/examples/pivot/utilities/PivotEnvironmentFactory.html.

An OCL parsing activity maintains the root and nested parsing context in
"@Environment@":http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/ocl/javadoc/4.0.0/org/eclipse/ocl/examples/pivot/Environment.html
instances which are created by an
"@EnvironmentFactory@":http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/ocl/javadoc/4.0.0/org/eclipse/ocl/examples/pivot/EnvironmentFactory.html.

@Environment@ s nest.  Usually the root environment has
no correlation to an element in the model, or it may correspond to some
@Package@ providing a default namespace (called a package
context).  Alternatively, it may contain one or more nested environments
defining package namespaces.  A package context contains one or more classifier
contexts, which in turn can contain operation and/or attribute contexts.  Whereas
the purpose of a package context is primarily to assist in the look-up of named
model elements, the classifier, operation, and attribute contexts have deeper
meaning.

A classifier context defines the type of the @self@
variable in OCL constraints and queries.  By itself, it is the context for
invariant constraints for the context classifier.  Additionally, as the parent
context for operation and attribute constraints, it indicates the classifier
in which context an operation or attribute constraint applies; this may be the
classifier that defines these features, or it may inherit them from some more
general classifier.

An @Environment@ may contain named
"@Variable@":http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/ocl/javadoc/4.0.0/org/eclipse/ocl/examples/pivot/Variable.html s
to which OCL expressions can refer.  The most common of these is
@self@.  Others include the parameters defined by an
operation (and its @result@), in the case of an
operation context.  The OCL API even allows clients to add variables, in code,
to define "global" names.

h3. Creating an OCL Environment

The static factory methods on the @OCL@ class are used
to create instances.  It is a good practice to re-use the same OCL instance for
all parsing and evaluation of constraints and queries on a model while that
model is loaded (usually in some @ResourceSet@ in an
editor). It is also good practice to invoke @dispose()@ to release all
OCL-related Resource references.

Using the shared Pivot environment factory , we can create an OCL
environment suitable for parsing OCL constraints on any Ecore model and
evaluating them on instances of the model:

h3. The OCL Helper

From an OCL instance, we can create a helper object with which to parse constraints
and additional operation/attribute definitions.

!{width:60%}images/6310-oclhelper.png(OCL Parsing Helper API)! 

The @OCLHelper@ is primarily designed for parsing
constraints and query expressions embedded in models, providing the following
API for that purpose:

* @createQuery()@: parses a query expression
* @createConstraint()@: parses a constraint of a given @ConstraintKind@
* @createInvariant()@: convenience for invariant constraints
* @createPrecondition()@: convenience for pre-condition constraints
* @createPostcondition()@: convenience for post-condition constraints
* @createBodyCondition()@: convenience for body conditions
* @createDerivedValueExpression()@: convenience for attribute derived values

Different kinds of constraints require different context environments.  The
@setContext()@, @setOperationContext()@,
and @setAttributeContext()@ methods create the appropriate
nested @Environment@ s in the host @OCL@
instance's root environment.

The result of parsing a query expression or a constraint is an
"@ExpressionInOCL@":http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/ocl/javadoc/4.0.0/org/eclipse/ocl/expressions/ExpressionInOCL.html,
an instance of the "Abstract Syntax Model":#AbstractSyntax.

bq.. 
The Ecore/UML binding variously produces a Constraint or OCLEXpression result. A Constraint has too much context and an OCLExpression too little. An ExpressionInOCL is just right.

h3. Operation and Attribute Contexts

In the case of constraints on operations or attributes, the context consists
of two elements:  the constrained operation/attribute and a classifier in the
context of which the constraint is to apply.  This accounts for the possibility
that a classifier defines constraints on inherited features.  As an example,
consider the @EModelElement::getEAnnotation(EString)@
operation and @EReference::eReferenceType@ property in the Ecore
metamodel.  These can be constrained as follows:
